**Overview:**
Project started as an uni project, but i build aditional functionality on top of that. It takes radiograph pictures and modifies its gamma, and sharpness values to increase the visibility.
The results are a certain number of png files, named accordingly with the modification that was made, as well as the intensity of an operation that was performed. 

> Modifying values of rgb values are performed manually, without addidional packages

> User is able to determine the number and intensity of performed actions

> All files are being organized in directories
